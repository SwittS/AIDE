Welcome to AIDE
===============
Hi, <%= @user.first_name %>! Whether you're a patient or a caregiver, here at AIDE we strive to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships. We're so glad you've decided to use our services to better the lives around you. Thank you!

Getting started:
If you're a patient, begin by editing your profile page. Next, use our Caregiver Directory to find the perfect caregiver for you! There you can search caregivers by specific healthcare needs and have the ability to filter by location or credentials.

When you find a caregiver that fulfills your necessary requirements, click the 'Send an email to this caregiver' button on the bottom of the caregiver's profile! After completing your inquiry, the caregiver will find an appropriate time to contact you
via email. That email will serve as the initial contact with a potential caregiver match.

If you're a caregiver, begin by editing your profile page. Please make sure you fill out the necessary requirements. This is essential to our patient connection because of the specificity of services needed ensures a good fit. After completion, you can
explore the caregivers community at AIDE. If your specialties fit a patients' needs, you will receive an email with their contact information. That email will serve as the initial contact with a potential patient match.

Best,

The Team @ Aide Initiative
